        <h1>Modest Proposal</h1>
        
        <p> preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,
            from being a burden on their parents or country,
            and for making them beneficial to the publick.</p>

    <p>It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,
        or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and
        cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,
        four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for
        an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest
        livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg
        sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn
        thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
        for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>
        
    <p>is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of
        children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their
        mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable
        state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore
        whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these
        children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so
        well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of
        the nation.</p>

        <P>The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million
            and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred
            thousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract
            thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children,
            (although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present
            distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a
            hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand,
            for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or
            disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty
            thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore
            is, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have
            already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly
            impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither
            employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I
            mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a
            livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where
            they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments
            much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked
            upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal
            gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never
            knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of
            the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.</P>
